Streams in Node.js provide an efficient way to handle data flow, especially when dealing with large datasets or real-time data. Instead of loading the entire dataset into memory at once, streams process data in smaller, manageable chunks. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and improves performance.
There are four primary types of streams in Node.js:
1. Readable Streams: These streams represent a source from which data can be read. Examples include fs.createReadStream for reading files, http.IncomingMessage for handling incoming HTTP requests, and process.stdin for standard input.
2. Writable Streams: These streams represent a destination to which data can be written. Examples include fs.createWriteStream for writing to files, http.ServerResponse for sending HTTP responses, and process.stdout for standard output.
3. Duplex Streams: These streams are both Readable and Writable, allowing data to be read from and written to the same stream. A common example is a TCP socket connection.
4. Transform Streams: These streams are a type of Duplex stream that can modify or transform data as it passes through. They are often used for filtering, compressing, or converting data formats.

Instead of loading the entire dataset into memory at once, streams process data in smaller, manageable chunks. This approach significantly reduces memory usage and improves performance.
There are four primary types of streams in Node.js:
1. Readable Streams: These streams represent a source from which data can be read. Examples include fs.createReadStream for reading files, http.IncomingMessage for handling incoming HTTP requests, and process.stdin for standard input.
2. Writable Streams: These streams represent a destination to which data can be written. Examples include fs.createWriteStream for writing to files, http.ServerResponse for sending HTTP responses, and process.stdout for standard output.
3. Duplex Streams: These streams are both Readable and Writable, allowing data to be read from and written to the same stream. A common example is a TCP socket connection.
4. Transform Streams: These streams are a type of Duplex stream that can modify or transform data as it passes through. They are often used for filtering, compressing, or converting data formats.
